We're merely dipping our toe into the shallow end here, not plunging head first into the deep end. But I hope maybe it entices you to swim around, because the water's actually quite pleasant!\r\n\r\nWe'll look at familiar problems in code that we typically solve imperatively, and then see how some of the de-mystified behaviors associated with monads (and friends!) can help. After this talk, I hope you'll look more closely at monads and other algebraic structures.\r\n\r\nTopics illustrated: selecting values with conditional logic, forking behavior on exceptions, and juggling asynchronous side effects.",

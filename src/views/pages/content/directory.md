![conference directory](/images/cjs19-directory.png)

Just like [last year](https://2019.cascadiajs.com/directory) we are going to build a Conference Directory that displays who's coming to CascadiaJS 2020 and support filtering based on things like "lives in Vancouver, BC" or "builds apps using VueJS". Our goal is to help attendees connect before, during and after the conference.

In order to get listed in the Conference Directory, you'll need to create a [Fizbuz](https://fizbuz.com) account. Fizbuz is a professional network designed for developers, and we're partnering with Fizbuz to help attendees connect with one another.

1. [Create](https://fizbuz.com/signup) a Fizbuz account
2. Click on "edit" for Experiences
3. Click "Add Experience"
4. For "Place", simply enter "CascadiaJS 2020"
5. Click "Save" and you're done!

title: Hallway Track
---

CascadiaJS isn't the same without the Hallway Track. This is where you meet new people and re-connect with old friends. Where you discuss the merits of semicolons and the whether umbrellas are neccessary if you live in the Pacific Northwest. 

We couldn't imagine having CascadiaJS without a great Hallway Track, so we hope you like the options were are providing for this event. Please note that our [Code of Conduct](/coc) applies to **all three** of these platforms. 

## Small-group video chat (powered by Remo)

From 10am PDT to 3pm PDT on both days, we will have a virtual meeting space up and running powered by [Remo](https://remo.co).

Remo is a virtual event platform that allow us to create a floor that has tables and chairs. Each table can accommodate a maximum of 6 people, and once you "sit down" you will be in a video chat (video + audio) with the other people seated at that table.

A few instructions on how to use Remo:

- When you enter the event, make sure to turn-on your camera and microphone (buttons at the bottom)
- Take a second to edit your profile (upper right) and upload a photo and set your display name
- Double-click on a chair to "sit down" and join the video chat
- Click on "Tile View" to make everyone's video big
- Click on "Floor Plan View" to shrink the videos and reveal the floor plan

A few tips on getting the most out of the event:

- Be a good listener, don't dominate the conversation
- Remember the two feet rule: feel free to leave a table whenever you like.
- Remember the Pacman rule: always try to leave a chair open at your table, if possible.

The folks at Voicebox Karaoke are going to run a post-meetup karaoke party for us!

We'll be hosting two Karaoke virtual rooms.

## To Join the Virtual Karaoke Room via Video

- Install Zoom (ðŸ˜‚)
- Grab the Karaoke room's Zoom link in the [Dashboard](/home) and jot down the Voicebox control code
- Join Zoom on a laptop or desktop (not mobile)
- Use a pair of headphones with a built in mic for best sound
- Have your smartphone handy because you will use this as a remote to browse songs & request songs

## How do I browse and request my song to sing?

- On your smartphone, visit the [Voicebox](https://vbsongs.com) site
- Browse and request your song (you'll see links on the site as New Songs, Categories, Top 100, Roulette or Search), and enter the control code when prompted. The code is available in the [Dashboard](/home).

For example, if you click `Top 100`:

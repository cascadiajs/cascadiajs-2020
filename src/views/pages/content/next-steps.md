Thanks for buying a ticket to CascadiaJS 2020. We're so excited that you're going to join us in Cyberspace this year!

## First, verify your Access Code

In order to participate in the conference (watch the Live Stream, hang out with people in Remo, etc) you will need to log-in to the Conference Dashboard using an Access Code. Please ensure that you are able to log-in prior to Sept 1 so that there is time to sort out any issues before the conference begins!

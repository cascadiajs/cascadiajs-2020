title: Using Remo
---

Remo is the platform we are using for face-to-face video chat in our Hallway Track. Remo allows us to create a virtual event space, complete with tables and chairs. Here's what you can expect:

- Tables that can seat either 2, 4 or six people.
- Once a table is full, no one else can join that table, so remember the Pac-Man rule!
- Some tables are labeled, so look for:
    - Sponsor tables
    - Topic tables (i.e. React.js)
    - Location tables (i.e. Vancouver, BC).
- Many tables are un-labeled, so talk about whatever you like!

Here is a list of [supported browsers](https://help.remo.co/support/solutions/articles/63000250999-what-mobile-devices-and-browsers-are-supported-on-remo-conference-) for Remo.

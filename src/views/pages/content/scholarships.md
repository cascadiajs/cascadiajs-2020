CascadiaJS exists to educate and grow the JavaScript community in the Pacific Northwest. We're constantly seeking new ways to make our community broader and more inclusive, so we're excited to work with our community to fund this year's Opportunity Scholarship Program.

## Requirements

The Scholarship Program is open to everyone who meets these requirements:

- Able to attend both days of the conference (Sept 1 &amp; Sept 2)
- Member of an under-represented minority (URM) in tech 

## How it works

- Apply for a scholarship by <span class="highlight warning">July 31</a>
- If you meet the requirements above, you will be offered a scholarship ticket for the discounted rate of $29
- If you cannot afford that, that's ok! You can request Financial Aid and we'll be in touch.


## Please help us spread the word!

Please help us in our outreach efforts. Take a moment to share this post with relevant people or organizations. We hope this Scholarship Program can enable you to join us and contribute to our community!

## How do I show my appreciation at the end of the talk?

When we're physically together, everyone hears your clap in appreciation.

We've brought this experience online!

* Click on the Smiley Face widget in the bottom left corner of the window. The "Share how you feel!" dialog pops up.

* Click on any of the icons to show your appreciation. You (and all attendees) will hear your clap, and the widget keeps track of appreciations for that talk as well.

* To toggle the clapping audio on/off, see the `Clapping Audio` toggle in the top right of the window.

## Adjusting your view

To maximize the video window, you can hide the `Slack View` on the right of the video, or hide the `Captions` below the video. See the toggles in the top right of the window.

## How do I ask questions?

Ask a question in the Q&A widget on the left side of the window. Type your question, or up-vote an existing question.

## What are Talk Illustrations?

Each talk has an associated illustration created by [Mind's Eye Creative](https://www.mindseyecreative.ca).

## Can I easily view the talk schedule from the Live Stream page?

A copy of the schedule is below the Live Stream. It's a bit hidden due to auto-sizing of the page. Just use the vertical scrollbar to scroll down to the schedule.

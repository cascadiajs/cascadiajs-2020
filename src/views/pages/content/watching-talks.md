title: How to Watch the Talks
---

The live stream of talks will take place on here on our website.

<div class="cta"><a href="/live">Tune-In to the Live Stream</a></div>

We also encourage you to join the **#live** channel on [our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cascadiajs/shared_invite/zt-gxn6l31s-Grym6ikdMaTcNMe26iOUjw). That's where you will be able to hang out with fellow attendees and ask questions during the Q&A portion.

For your convenience, we will also be displaying the Slack chat conversation on the website in read-only mode next to the live stream.

## Turning on Audio

### Unmute Stream Audio

The video stream by default is muted. Unmute in the bottom left. See "play" button in screenshot below.

### Turn on Audio for Clapping

There's a new feature that lets you clap to show your appreciation.

In the Slack **#live** channel, when you use the emoji `:clap:` all viewers will see an animation on the site as well as hear a clap noise.

To hear the noise yourself, you need to enable the audio for this feature.

Directly underneath the talk videos, you'll see **Turn Clapping Audio On** button.

_Note that if your browser window is wide, you may not see the button due to the auto-sizing of the video window. In this case, just scroll down a bit to see the button._

See "Turn Clapping Audio On" button in screenshot.
